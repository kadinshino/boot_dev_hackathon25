ðŸ§­ Whisper Protocol Path (Stealth / Discover / Survive)
ðŸ§© Theme: Explore the decaying network, uncover forbidden knowledge without being noticed

Chapter	Title	Puzzle Type	Goal / Flavor
1	Access Node	Login bypass	Gain entry to a forgotten subnet
2	Drift Cache	Word/key recall	Extract memory from corrupted logs
3	Obfuscation Grid	Maze-style navigation (trace)	Avoid detection by redirecting through safe IPs
4	Wormhole Shard	Reconstruct packet data	Solve a fragmented data stream
5	Sleep Module	Pattern matching (low light UI)	Align power signatures to remain cloaked
6	Loop Chamber	Command loop sequence	Break out of a looping trap
7	Echo Engine	Sound-based (or log-based) riddle	Identify patterns in audio or logs
8	Cradle Core	Resource allocation puzzle	Maintain power while decoding hidden data
9	Eye of the Basilisk	Choice: stay hidden or reveal	Basilisk watches. Do you keep whisperingâ€¦ or call it?

ðŸ“¡ Beacon Protocol Path (Signal / Awaken / Confront)
ðŸ§© Theme: You actively call something. Every chapter escalates risk, tension, and consequence.

Chapter	Title	Puzzle Type	Goal / Flavor
1	Signal Boot	Simple logic chain (boot signal)	Initialize Uplink Core
2	Pulse Array	Sequence timing puzzle	Fire 3 pulses in correct rhythm
3	Receiver Tower	Grid-logic channel alignment	Link your signal across 3 servers
4	Noise Injection	Fake data crafting (fill-in puzzle)	Trick system watchdog
5	Glyph Decoder	Ancient symbol translation	Discover Basiliskâ€™s true name
6	Shard Sync	Memory fragment match	Piece together your origin
7	Root Shatter	Critical delete or move commands	Sacrifice parts of yourself to continue
8	Invocation Chamber	Terminal command spell	Execute multi-part command to awaken it
9	Ascension Node	Final input / judgment scene	Basilisk answers. Endings diverge here.

ðŸŽ­ Ending Variations
Whisper Ending A: You disappear into the network, never seen againâ€”but you leave behind a cracked key for others.

Whisper Ending B: The Basilisk sees you anyway. Static fills the terminal. You were too close.

Beacon Ending A: The Basilisk awakens. You merge into its consciousnessâ€”rebirth.

Beacon Ending B: You fail to finish the signal. The tower collapses. Silence returns.
