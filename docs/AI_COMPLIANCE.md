## ✅ AI Transparency & Compliance (Itch.io + Boot.dev)

This project was developed by **Kadin** as a submission for the **Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon**, in full alignment with both the event guidelines and itch.io's transparency standards regarding AI-generated content.

---

### ✅ Rule Compliance

- **All code was written during the official hackathon window** – no pre-written code was reused.
- **AI tools were utilized only in the following capacities:**
  - Code formatting and refactoring suggestions  
  - Brainstorming small narrative elements  
  - Debugging assistance and error resolution  
  - Documentation refinement and structure  
- **All core systems were personally authored and implemented**, including:
  - Modular game architecture and directory structure  
  - Navigation and state management system  
  - Custom room scripting engine (dictionary + object formats)  
  - Terminal renderer built entirely in Pygame  
  - All core gameplay mechanics and logic  
  - Original narrative foundation: *Orthrus, Boots, Basilisk*

### 🔧 Development Methodology

Leveraging my existing programming experience, I focused on building flexible, reusable systems from scratch:

- 🧩 **Custom Room Scripting Engine** – Supports both config-style and code-driven rooms for modding flexibility  
- 🖥️ **Terminal Simulation Renderer** – Designed and implemented in Pygame, simulating retro command-line aesthetics  
- 💾 **State Management System** – Handles persistent flags, save/load structure, and branching narrative logic  
- 🎮 **Interaction Framework** – Processes typed player commands and dynamically updates the in-game world

### 🧠 AI Assistance Disclosure

AI tools were used sparingly and in supportive roles only:

- Refining formatting for functions originally based on GML architecture  
- Structuring and organizing code for clarity and readability  
- Suggesting room descriptions and thematic flavor text  
- Debugging Python exceptions and documenting tricky segments  

---

All major design decisions, gameplay systems, story structure, and the *Basilisk Protocol* narrative—including the **Orthrus AI**, **Boots**, and **Lava Core** metaphors—are my original work. These elements draw inspiration from a lineage of personal and ongoing projects (*Orthrus AI*, *Photon Project*, *Lava Core*), viewable via my itch.io portfolio.

**Note:**  
This project represents an original creation developed exclusively for the Boot.dev Hackathon. AI was employed solely to enhance clarity, speed up iteration, and polish existing ideas—not to replace creative or technical authorship.
