# [BASILISK_PROTOCOL] – Build & Export Guide

This guide explains how to build and export the `[BASILISK_PROTOCOL]` terminal ARG into a standalone `.exe` file for Windows.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before building, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** installed  
  > _Works with Microsoft Store, regular Python installer, or Anaconda_  
- **Pygame** and **PyInstaller** installed  
- Access to the full project folder (includes `main.py`, `assets/`, and the `dist\build.bat` script)

---

## 🚀 How to Export the Game

1. **Install Python Packages**  
   Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
   ```powershell
   pip install pygame pyinstaller
   ```
   > If you get permission errors, try: `python -m pip install pygame pyinstaller`

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory**  
   Open your terminal in the project's `dist/` folder where `build.bat` is located.

3. **Run the Build Script**  
   Execute the build script:
   ```powershell
   .\build.bat
   ```
   > **Double-clicking** the `.bat` file also works!

4. **Wait for Build to Complete**  
   The improved script will:
   - **Automatically detect** PyInstaller from multiple common locations
   - Clean previous build files
   - Validate that all required files exist
   - Package the game into a standalone `.exe`
   - Output the file directly into the `dist/` folder

5. **Find Your Game Executable**  
   After a successful build, your exported game will be:
   ```
   dist\BASILISK_PROTOCOL.exe
   ```

## 🧼 What Gets Cleaned

Each time you build, the script automatically removes:

- The temporary `build/` folder
- Any `.spec` files generated by PyInstaller
- Previous `.exe` outputs (to avoid clutter)

You don't need to delete anything manually.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Issue                                    | Fix                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PyInstaller not found`                  | The script will show installation instructions. Run `pip install pyinstaller` and try again |
| `main.py not found`                      | Make sure you're running the script from the `dist/` folder with `main.py` in the parent directory |
| Build fails with import errors          | Install missing packages: `pip install pygame` or other dependencies shown in the error      |
| Assets not loading in final `.exe`      | Ensure the `assets/` folder exists next to `main.py` - the script will include it automatically |
| Console window showing during gameplay  | Remove `--noconsole` from `build.bat` if you want a debug terminal (useful for development)   |
| Script can't find PyInstaller location  | The new script checks multiple locations automatically, but you can add PyInstaller to your system PATH |

## 🔧 Build Script Improvements

The updated `build.bat` includes several enhancements:

- **Smart PyInstaller Detection**: Automatically finds PyInstaller in common installation locations
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when something goes wrong
- **Path Validation**: Checks that required files exist before building
- **Cross-Installation Support**: Works with Windows Store Python, regular Python, and Anaconda
- **Build Verification**: Confirms the `.exe` was actually created successfully

---

## 🧠 Custom Builds (Mods, Themes)

You are encouraged to:

- **Create mods** using your own rooms, themes, and logic
- **Replace `main.py`** with your own gameplay structure
- **Rebrand the export** by changing the `OUTPUT_NAME` variable in `build.bat`
- **Share your builds** or distribute `.exe` versions of your game
- **Modify the build script** to include additional assets or change build settings

### Example Customizations:
```batch
REM Change the output name
set OUTPUT_NAME=MY_CUSTOM_BASILISK

REM Add console window for debugging
REM Remove --noconsole from the PyInstaller command

REM Include additional data files
REM Add more --add-data flags for extra resources
```

## 📤 Sharing Your Build

When sharing your `.exe` file:

- **Test on a different computer** to ensure it works standalone
- **Include any custom assets** that might be needed
- **Provide clear instructions** for running the game
- **Consider file size** - the `.exe` will be larger due to bundled Python runtime

> **Tip**: The generated `.exe` is completely portable and doesn't require Python to be installed on the target machine!

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check the console output** - the build script provides detailed error messages
2. **Verify your Python installation** - run `python --version` to confirm
3. **Test with a simple Python script** first to ensure PyInstaller works
4. **Check file permissions** - ensure you can write to the `dist/` folder
