# Architecture Overview

## Design Philosophy

The Basilisk ARG is built with two core principles in mind: **accessibility for modders** and **professional code organization**. Drawing from our experience with GameMaker Language (GML), we've created a Python-based architecture that feels familiar to game developers while remaining approachable for ARG fans who want to create their own content.

## Why Two Development Styles?

### Dictionary-Based Rooms: For the Community

```python
ROOM_CONFIG = {
    "name": "Digital Archive",
    "entry_text": ["You enter a vast digital archive."]
}

PUZZLE_PATH = {
    "examine_terminal": {
        "command": "examine terminal",
        "success": ["The terminal flickers to life."]
    }
}
```

**Why we built this:**
- **Zero barrier to entry** - Anyone who can edit a text file can create rooms
- **Self-documenting** - The structure explains itself
- **ARG tradition** - Many ARGs thrive on community-created content
- **Rapid prototyping** - Test ideas without learning complex systems

This approach mirrors configuration files from classic modding communities, where players could create new content by editing simple data files without touching core code.

### Object-Oriented Rooms: For Complex Mechanics

```python
class DigitalArchive(BaseRoom):
    def __init__(self):
        config = RoomConfig(
            name="Digital Archive",
            entry_text=["You enter a vast digital archive."]
        )
        super().__init__(config)
```

**Why we built this:**
- **Clean code organization** - Encapsulation and inheritance for complex puzzles
- **Reusable components** - Base classes for common room types
- **State management** - Easier to handle complex game states
- **Professional structure** - Maintainable for long-term development

## GameMaker Heritage

Coming from GameMaker development, we applied several GML patterns to Python:

### Room-Based Architecture
```
GameMaker:                     Python Equivalent:
├── Rooms/                     ├── rooms/
│   ├── rm_start              │   ├── rm_start.py
│   ├── rm_level_1            │   ├── rm_level_1.py
│   └── rm_boss               │   └── rm_boss.py
```

Just like GameMaker's room system, each room is:
- **Self-contained** - All logic for a room lives in one file
- **Independently loadable** - Rooms can be added/removed without affecting others
- **Event-driven** - Rooms respond to player inputs (like GML events)

### Event System Translation

```python
# GML Event System → Python Methods
Create Event      → def __init__(self)
Step Event        → def update(self, game_state)  
Key Press Event   → def handle_input(self, cmd, game_state)
Draw Event        → def get_display_text(self, game_state)
Room Start        → def enter_room(self, game_state)
Room End          → def exit_room(self, game_state)
```

### State Management Pattern

Drawing from GML's instance variables and global variables:

```python
# GML: global.player_health = 100
# Python: game_state.set("player_health", 100)

# GML: if (instance_exists(obj_key)) 
# Python: if "key" in game_state.inventory:

# GML: room_goto(rm_next)
# Python: transition_to_room("rm_next", ["Leaving..."])
```

## Modular Design

### Core System (Protected)
```
resources/
├── game_engine.py      # Core engine - rarely modified
├── room_utils.py       # Utilities and base classes
└── terminal_themes.py  # Visual customization
```

### Content Layer (Moddable)
```
rooms/
├── rm_*.py            # All game content
├── custom_*.py        # Community rooms
└── mod_*.py           # Player modifications
```

This separation ensures:
- **Core stability** - Engine remains untouched by mods
- **Easy distribution** - Share a single .py file to add content
- **Safe experimentation** - Broken mods won't crash the game
- **Version compatibility** - Mods work across updates

## Module Loading System

Our dynamic loading system (inspired by GML's resource tree) automatically discovers and loads rooms:

```python
# Automatic discovery - just like GameMaker's resource tree
for file in os.listdir("rooms/"):
    if file.startswith("rm_") and file.endswith(".py"):
        # Automatically available in game
```

This means:
- **No registration required** - Drop in a file and it works
- **Hot-swappable** - Add/remove rooms without recompiling
- **Conflict-free** - Rooms don't interfere with each other

## Why This Architecture?

### 1. **Lowering the Barrier**
ARGs thrive on community participation. By offering dictionary-based rooms, we enable:
- Writers to create story content
- Puzzle designers to craft challenges  
- Fans to extend the narrative
- No programming knowledge required

### 2. **Professional Foundation**
The OOP system provides:
- Maintainable codebase for core developers
- Complex puzzle implementations
- Reusable components and patterns
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. **Familiar Patterns**
GameMaker developers will recognize:
- Room-based game flow
- Event-driven architecture
- Global state management
- Resource organization

### 4. **Best of Both Worlds**
Players can:
- Start with simple dictionary rooms
- Graduate to OOP as they learn
- Mix both styles in one project
- Choose the right tool for each room

## Example: From GML to Python

### GameMaker Room Script:
```gml
// Room Creation Code
global.terminal_active = false;
instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_terminal);

// obj_terminal Step Event
if (keyboard_check_pressed(vk_space)) {
    if (distance_to_object(obj_player) < 32) {
        global.terminal_active = true;
        show_message("Terminal activated!");
    }
}
```

### Python Equivalent (Dictionary):
```python
PUZZLE_PATH = {
    "activate_terminal": {
        "command": "activate terminal",
        "sets": "terminal_active",
        "success": ["Terminal activated!"]
    }
}
```

### Python Equivalent (OOP):
```python
class TerminalRoom(BaseRoom):
    def _setup_puzzles(self):
        self.processor.add_command(
            PuzzleCommand(
                command="activate terminal",
                sets="terminal_active", 
                success=["Terminal activated!"]
            )
        )
```

## Performance Considerations

### Text-Based Advantage

Coming from GameMaker, we're used to optimizing sprite rendering, collision detection, and draw calls. The Basilisk's text-based nature eliminates these concerns, allowing us to focus on:

```python
# Traditional GameMaker Performance Concerns:
- Sprite batching and texture pages
- Instance deactivation outside view
- Collision optimization with spatial hashing

# The Basilisk Performance Concerns:
- String operations and text parsing
- Module loading times
- State dictionary lookups
```

### Module Loading Strategy

Unlike GameMaker's compile-time resource tree, we use dynamic imports:

```python
# Lazy loading - rooms load only when needed
def load_room(room_name):
    if room_name not in loaded_rooms:
        module = importlib.import_module(f"rooms.rm_{room_name}")
        loaded_rooms[room_name] = module
    return loaded_rooms[room_name]
```

**Performance Impact:**
- First room entry: ~5-10ms load time
- Subsequent entries: <1ms (cached)
- Memory usage: ~1-2KB per room

### State Management Efficiency

We chose dictionaries over classes for game state (similar to GML's ds_map):

```python
# Efficient O(1) lookups
game_state.flags["terminal_active"]  # Fast
game_state.get_flag("terminal_active")  # Convenience wrapper

# Avoid repeated calculations
# Bad:
for i in range(100):
    if game_state.get("complex_calculation"):
        # Recalculates every time

# Good:
result = game_state.get("complex_calculation")
for i in range(100):
    if result:
        # Uses cached value
```

### Dictionary vs OOP Performance

| Operation | Dictionary Room | OOP Room | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Load Time | ~5ms | ~8ms | Class instantiation overhead |
| Command Processing | O(n) | O(1) with hash | OOP can use method dispatch |
| Memory Usage | ~1KB | ~2KB | Object overhead |
| Puzzle Complexity | Linear | Optimizable | OOP allows caching strategies |

### Optimization Tips

#### For Dictionary Rooms:
```python
# Pre-sort commands by frequency
PUZZLE_PATH = {
    # Most common commands first
    "look": {...},
    "examine": {...},
    # Rare commands last
    "whisper ancient incantation": {...}
}

# Use early returns
def handle_input(cmd, game_state):
    # Check most common cases first
    if cmd in ["look", "l"]:
        return quick_look_response()
    
    # Then check puzzle paths
    return process_puzzle_command(cmd, game_state, PUZZLE_PATH)
```

#### For OOP Rooms:
```python
class OptimizedRoom(BaseRoom):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Pre-compile regex patterns
        self.patterns = {
            "use_item": re.compile(r"^use (\w+) on (\w+)$"),
            "combine": re.compile(r"^combine (\w+) with (\w+)$")
        }
        
        # Cache computed values
        self._command_map = self._build_command_map()
    
    def _build_command_map(self):
        """Build hash map for O(1) command lookup"""
        return {
            "look": self._handle_look,
            "examine": self._handle_examine,
            # ... more mappings
        }
```

### When Performance Matters

Text adventures rarely hit performance limits, but consider optimization when:

1. **Complex String Parsing**
   ```python
   # Slow: Multiple string operations
   if "key" in cmd and "door" in cmd and cmd.startswith("use"):
   
   # Fast: Compiled regex
   if self.use_pattern.match(cmd):
   ```

2. **Large State Spaces**
   ```python
   # For maze/grid puzzles with many states
   class MazeRoom(BaseRoom):
       def __init__(self):
           # Pre-calculate valid moves
           self.valid_moves = self._calculate_all_moves()
   ```

3. **Frequent State Checks**
   ```python
   # Cache complex conditions
   def enter_room(self, game_state):
       self.has_all_keys = all(
           f"key_{i}" in game_state.inventory 
           for i in range(5)
       )
   ```

### Memory Considerations

Unlike GameMaker's fixed room instances, Python modules stay loaded:

```python
# Rooms persist in memory once loaded
# Consider cleanup for large games:

def unload_distant_rooms(current_room, game_state):
    """Unload rooms more than 3 steps away"""
    for room_name in list(loaded_rooms.keys()):
        if get_distance(current_room, room_name) > 3:
            del loaded_rooms[room_name]
```

## Conclusion

This architecture represents a bridge between:
- **Amateur creativity** and **professional development**
- **Simple configuration** and **complex programming**
- **GameMaker patterns** and **Python idioms**
- **Individual rooms** and **cohesive experience**

By supporting both approaches, The Basilisk ARG creates an ecosystem where anyone can contribute, from writers crafting narrative moments to programmers building complex puzzles. The modular design ensures that the community can extend and modify the game while maintaining a stable, professional core.

This dual approach isn't a compromise—it's a recognition that great ARGs are built by communities, and communities include people with different skills and comfort levels. Whether you're editing your first dictionary or inheriting from BaseRoom, you're part of The Basilisk's evolution.

*The architecture is watching. Every room matters.*
