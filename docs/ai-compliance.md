## üõ†Ô∏è Hackathon Compliance & Development Notes

This project was built by **Kadin** for the **Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon** in full compliance with all rules:

### ‚úÖ Rule Compliance

* **All code was written after the hackathon start time**
* **AI tools were used only for:**
  - Code formatting and refactoring
  - Brainstorming ideas and small narrative elements
  - Debugging assistance
  - Documentation help
* **I personally authored all core systems:**
  - Game architecture and structure
  - Navigation and state management
  - Room scripting engine
  - Terminal renderer implementation
  - All gameplay logic and mechanics
  - Core Naration Orthrus, Boots, Basilisk

### üîß Development Approach

I leveraged my existing programming knowledge to build modular, reusable systems:

* **Custom room scripting engine** - Supports both dictionary and object-based room definitions
* **Terminal simulation renderer** - Built from scratch using Pygame
* **State management system** - Handles save/load and persistent game state
* **Interaction framework** - Processes player commands and updates game world

### üìù AI Usage Transparency

AI assistance was limited to:
- Suggesting code improvements for existing GML Based functions
- Helping format and organize code structure
- Generating narrative text and room descriptions "Helping notate code"
- Assisting with error messages and debugging

All core gameplay systems, architecture decisions, Orthrus and Baskilisk And core story, and implementation details were designed and coded by me. Orgin story, scope and Ideas are offshoots of existing and current projects. "Orthrus AI, Lava Core, Photon Project" that can be seen on itch.io

**Note:** This project represents original work created specifically for this hackathon, combining my programming skills with carefully scoped AI assistance for polish and refinement.
