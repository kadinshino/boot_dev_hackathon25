## üõ†Ô∏è Hackathon Compliance & Development Notes

This project was built by a **kadin** for the **Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon** in full compliance with all rules:

### ‚úÖ Rule Compliance

* **All code was written after the hackathon start time**
* **AI tools were used only for:**
  - Code formatting and refactoring
  - Brainstorming ideas and small narrative elements
  - Debugging assistance
  - Documentation help
* **I personally authored all core systems:**
  - Game architecture and structure
  - Navigation and state management
  - Room scripting engine
  - Terminal renderer implementation
  - All gameplay logic and mechanics
  - Core Naration Orthrus, Boots, Basilisk 

### üîß Development Approach

I leveraged my existing programming knowledge to build modular, reusable systems:

* **Custom room scripting engine** - Supports both dictionary and object-based room definitions
* **Terminal simulation renderer** - Built from scratch using Pygame
* **State management system** - Handles save/load and persistent game state
* **Interaction framework** - Processes player commands and updates game world

### üìù AI Usage Transparency

AI assistance was limited to:
- Suggesting code improvements for existing functions
- Helping format and organize code structure
- Generating narrative text and room descriptions
- Assisting with error messages and debugging

All core gameplay systems, architecture decisions, and implementation details were designed and coded by me.

**Note:** This project represents original work created specifically for this hackathon, combining my programming skills with carefully scoped AI assistance for polish and refinement.# SPYHVER-18: LOST
